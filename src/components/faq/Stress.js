    Our autonomic nervous system controls involuntary activities in the body like heart rate and digestion. Broken into two branches that function as dials, the sympathetic nervous system controls and stimulates an activating ‘fight or flight’ response, preparing you for perceived danger or arousal. The other branch, the parasympathetic nervous system, controls and stimulates your ‘rest and relax’ response, guiding you into a calm state.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
    Breathing is one exception to the autonomic systems in that it functions automatically and you can voluntarily control it. Because all of our autonomic systems are intricately linked, voluntarily changing your breathing rate or pattern can cause windfall effects throughout the entire body. Studies have shown breath practices to reduce symptoms of stress, anxiety, insomnia, PTSD, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention deficit disorder and schizophrenia.

        You can utilize breathing exercises which can assist you in activating the parasympathetic nervous system and suppressing the sympathetic nervous system in order to respond to stress effectively.
